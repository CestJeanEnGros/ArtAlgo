#Circles and lines

My first Algorithmic Art project. There is a total of 6 sketch showing the evolution of my project. To execute any of them you can load the index.html page in a web browser (probably won't work due to browser's restrictions) or open the whole folder inside VSCode using the extension Live Server, selectecting the desired sketch in index.html code then clicking on the button "Go Live" bottom left of VS Code.
