# Singularity

Welcome to my first Algorithmic Art project. Since I never used Javascript before I kept it simple with lines and circles. Here there is many itterations of my works from sketch1.js to sketch6.js. In the end I tried to play with adding music and 3D.

## How to run 

There is probably more than one way to run this but I personnaly set the right sketch in the HTML tag in index.html then use the Live Server extensions from VSCode to execute it on my web browser. Best result might be on Chrome or Opera since that's the two web browsers I used during development.
For some sketch you may have acces to slider bar allowing you to play with speed and rotation of the camera.

## Demonstrations
 
For moving sketch, videos of my work are available in the demonstrations folder. Meanwhile let me show you some screenshot of it :
